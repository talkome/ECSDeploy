# ECS with CI/CD

## Architecture Overview
- VPC with 2 Public + 2 Private subnets (2 AZs)
- Internet-facing ALB in public subnets
- ECS Fargate Service (2 tasks) in private subnets
- Private encrypted ECR repository
- VPC Endpoints for ECR & S3 (private access only)
- Full CI/CD pipeline using Github → CodeBuild → ECS

## CI/CD Pipeline
1. Push to Github triggers pipeline
2. CodeBuild:
   - Builds Docker image
   - Tags with short commit SHA
   - Pushes to ECR
   - Generates imagedefinitions.json
3. CodePipeline deploys new task definition to ECS service

## Files
- Dockerfile + index.html – simple Nginx "Hello World"
- buildspec.yml – full build process
- imagedefinitions.json – auto-generated by CodeBuild

- All resources created manually via AWS Console as requested.
- Pipeline successfully deploys on every push.
